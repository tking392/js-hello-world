/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

// console.log("Hello, World!");

// 1. 
// console.log ("Coding is Cool!");

// 2. If you do not add the () the code will not run as the () are needed to designate what console.log will do. 
// console.log "Hello, World!";

// 3. You need both "" in your code otherwise it will not run. The "" are needed to tell what console.log() will output
// console.log (Hello, World!);

// 4. The code still runs without ; however this will cause problems when you add more code to the equation as the ; acts like a period. 
// console.log("Hello, World!")

// 5. 
// console.log ("392");

// 6. 
// console.log ("Hello!");
// console.log ("Oh, Hi Mark.");

// 7. 
// console.log ("Do", "Re", "Mi", "Fa", "So", "La", "Ti", "Do");

// 8. 
// console.log (' "You Miss 100% of the shots you dont take - Wayne Gretzky" - Michael Scott');

// 9. 
console.log ("Dude! You got a tattoo!");
console.log ("So do you, dude! Dude, what does my tattoo say?");
console.log ('"Sweet!" What about mine?');
console.log ('"Dude!" What does mine say?');
console.log ('"Sweet!" What about mine?');

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
